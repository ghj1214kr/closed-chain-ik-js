A generalized inverse kinematics solver that supports closed chains for parallel kinematics systems, dynamic reconfiguration, and arbitrary joint configuration based on damped least squares error minimization techniques. Supports all variety of joints including combinations of rotation and translation degrees of freedom and is agnostic to visualization framework. Inspired by [Marty Vona's MSim research work](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/gpc/MSim/MSim-info.html) and using techniques outlined in this [2009 paper by Samuel Buss](https://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/ikmethods/iksurvey.pdf). Developed with some aid and advice from [Marty Vona](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/gpc/vona.html).

# Use

## Simple 2 DoF System

```js
import { Solver, Joint, Link, Goal, DOF } from 'closed-chain-ik';

// Create links and joints
const link1 = new Link();

const joint1 = new Joint();
joint.setDoF( DOF.EZ );
joint.setPosition( 0, 1, 0 );
joint.setDoFValues( Math.PI / 4 );

const link2 = new Link();

const joint2 = new Joint();
joint.setDoF( DOF.EX );
joint.setPosition( 0, 1, 0 );
joint.setDoFValues( Math.PI / 4 );

const link3 = new Link();
link3.setPosition( 0, 1, 0 );

// Create the goal
const goal = new Goal();
link3.getWorldPosition( goal.position );
link3.getWorldQuaternion( goal.quaternion );

// Create structure
link1.addChild( joint1 );
joint1.addChild( link2 );
link2.addChild( joint2 );
joint2.addChild( link3 );

goal.makeClosure( link3 );

// create solver
const solver = new Solver( link1 );

// ...

// move the goal around and solve
goal.setPosition( 1, 2, 3 );
solver.solve();
```

## Using a WebWorker Solver

```js
import { WorkerSolve, Joint, Link, Goal, DOF } from 'closed-chain-ik';

// ... instantiate kinematic system...

const solver = new WorkerSolver( link1 );

// ...

// move the goal around and solve asynchronously
solver.solve();
```

# Caveats

- The web worker implementation uses ShareArrayBuffers which are not available on some platforms (Safari, Chrome for Android). See issue [#44](https://github.com/gkjohnson/closed-chain-ik-js/issues/44).

- Smoothing out 3DoF non closure ball joint behavior is in progress. See issue [#22](https://github.com/gkjohnson/closed-chain-ik-js/issues/22).

- Enabling SVD on the Solver can cause divergence on solvable systems and stutter. See [#76](https://github.com/gkjohnson/closed-chain-ik-js/issues/76).

## Solver

Class for solving the closure and target joint constraints of a sytem. As well as the listed fields a set of "options" are set on the object which are listed here:

```js
// Whether or not to use the SVD when calculating the pseudo inverse of the jacobian
// which can result in a more numerically stable calculation. If the SVD cannot be calculated
// then the transpose method is used.
useSVD = true;

// The max amount of iterations to try to solve for. The solve will terminate
// with SOLVE_STATUS.TIMEOUT if this limit is exceeded.
maxIterations = 5;

// The threshold under which a joint is not considered to have really moved. If
// no joint is moved more than this threshold then the solve will terminate with
// SOLVE_STATUS.STALLED.
stallThreshold = 1e-4;

// The threshold for comparing how much error has changed between solve iterations.
// If the error has grown by more than this threshold then the solve will terminate
// with SOLVE_STATUS.DIVERGED.
divergeThreshold = 0.01;

// The fixed damping factor to use in the DLS calculation.
dampingFactor = 0.001;

// The factor with which to move the joints towards the rest pose if set.
restPoseFactor = 0.01;

// The thresholds with which to compute whether or not the translation or rotation
// goals have been met. If the error between target and goal is under these
// thresholds then the solve will terminate with SOLVE_STATUS.CONVERGED.
translationConvergeThreshold = 1e-3;
rotationConvergeThreshold = 1e-5;

// Factors to apply to the translation and rotation error in the error vector.
// Useful for weighting rotation higher than translation if they do not seem to
// be solved "evenly". Values are expected to be in the range [ 0, 1 ].
translationFactor = 1;
rotationFactor = 1;

// The amount to move a joint when calculating the change in error a joint has
// for a jacobian.
translationStep = 1e-3;
rotationStep = 1e-3;

// The step to take towards the IK goals when solving. Setting this to a larger value
// may solve more quickly but may lead also lead to divergence.
translationErrorClamp = 0.1;
rotationErrorClamp = 0.1;
```

### .roots

```js
roots : Array<Frame>
```

The list of roots that should be accounted for in a solve. When `.updateStructure` is called the series of roots are traversed including closure joints to find all connected link hierarchies to use in the solve.

### .constructor

```js
constructor( roots : Array<Frame> )
```

Constructor takes a list of roots to solve for.

### .solve

```js
solve() : Array<SOLVE_STATUS>
```

Traverses the given set of roots to find joint chains to solve for and attempts to solve for the error in the system goals. A result is returned for each independent chain found in the system.

### .updateStructure

```js
updateStructure() : void
```

Must be called whenever parent child relationships and structural changes related to the tree change or `.roots` is modified.

## WorkerSolver

Implements the interface defined by [Solver](#Solver) but runs the solve asynchronously on in a WebWorker. Results are automatically copied to the joint system being solved for.

> :warning: When [SharedArrayBuffers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) are not available new copies of `ArrayBuffer` are created every update and from the worker.

### .results

```js
results : Array<Solve_STATUS>
```

The list of the last results from the solve copied over from the WebWorker.

### .updateSolverSettings

```js
updateSolverSettings( settings : Object ) : void
```

Sets the solver settings in the WebWorker to the values in the given object. Valid "options" values are listed in the [Solver](#Solver) docs.

### .updateFrameState

```js
updateFrameState( ...jointsToUpdate : Array<Joint> = [] ) : void
```

Copies the joint settings for the given joints to the WebWorker for a solve. "Joint settings" include everything except for joint values (that the solver would be solving for) and parent child relationships. If joint values or parent child relationhips change then `updateStructure` must be called.

### .solve

```js
solve() : void
```

Starts a solve in the WebWorker if one is not active. The solve will terminate automatically if none of the results are `SOLVE_STATUS.TIMEOUT`.

### .stop

```js
stop() : void
```

Terminate any active solve in the WebWorker.

### .dispose

```js
dispose() : void
```

Terminates the WebWorker and sets members to null.

## IKRootsHelper

_extends THREE.Group_

A helper class for rendering the joints and links in a three.js scene. Renders frame relationships as lines and joints degrees of freedom with indicators based on the joint type.

### .roots

```js
roots : Array<Frame>
```

Set of roots to render in the helper visualization. If this is changed then `.updateStructure` must be called.

### .constructor

```js
constructor( roots : Array<Frame> )
```

Takes the set of roots to visualize.

### .setJointScale

```js
setJointScale( scale : Number ) : this
```

Sets the scale of the joint indicators.
